# Plant Leaf Disease Identification

This project involves the development of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model for identifying plant leaf diseases from images. The model is capable of accurately classifying 39 different types of plant leaf diseases.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an efficient and reliable image-based system for plant leaf disease identification using deep learning techniques. The project explores three different DCNN configurations, each designed to optimize performance and accuracy.

### Key Features

- **Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) Models**: Three different configurations (Conv-3 DCNN, Conv-4 DCNN, and Conv-5 DCNN) were proposed and evaluated.
- **High Accuracy**: 
  - Conv-3 DCNN: 97.23% accuracy
  - Conv-4 DCNN: 97.77% accuracy
  - Conv-5 DCNN: 96.56% accuracy
- **Comprehensive Classification**: Successfully classified 39 different classes of plant leaf diseases.
